#Background of the problem statement:

ICIN is one of the top banking firms that accepts deposits from the public for the purpose of lending loans to the public. It also invests an amount in securities. Recently, the business analysts noticed a drop in the number of customers of the bank.

The project will be delivered within four sprints with every sprint delivering a minimal viable product.
It is mandatory to perform proper sprint planning with user stories to develop all the components of the project.

The web application should be responsive and should fetch or send data dynamically without hardcoded values.
We must maintain the version of the application over GitHub and every new change should be sent to the repository.
We must implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
We should also deploy and host the application on an AWS EC2 instance.
We should also implement automation testing before the application enters the CI/CD pipeline.
We should use Git branching to separately perform the basic automation testing of application.
It contains rich front-end of the application, which is user- friendly and easy for the user to navigate through the application.
There will be two portals in the application, namely the admin and user portal.
